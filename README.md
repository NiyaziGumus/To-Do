## About the Project

This Advanced Todo List Application was developed as a part of my portfolio to demonstrate my front-end development skills. The main objective was to create a highly interactive and user-friendly web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. This project emphasizes clean code, modern web development practices, and the importance of persisting data across sessions using LocalStorage.

## Technologies

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and creating a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the dynamic functionalities of the todo list, including adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
- **LocalStorage**: Utilized to persist todo items across browser sessions, ensuring data is retained even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

## Features

- **Add, Complete, and Delete Tasks**: Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, or delete tasks from the list.
- **Data Persistence**: Implements LocalStorage to save and retrieve the state of your todo list, making your data persistent across browser sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Pure Frontend Implementation**: Showcases the capability to build interactive web applications using only frontend technologies.

## Usage

The application can be directly launched by opening the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No server setup or additional installations are required to run the project.
